# SecurityBot

Outstanding Features
* Allow the security interface to listen to ZM and post messages to slack proactively
* When under alarm, post a picture/still of the alarm event
* Make execution and listening of the security and human interfaces separate threads
* Create a common message bus pipe them together
* Make the loggers named after their interfaces, probably a sub-logger or something
